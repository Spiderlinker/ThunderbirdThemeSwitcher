# ThunderbirdThemeSwitcher
This application provides a nice User Interface to easily switch the theme of Thunderbird.
It does the downloading, unzipping, moving and editing the theme configuration for you.

### Themes
The available themes in this application are not made by me. They were created by the guys of [spymastermatt](https://github.com/spymastermatt/) at their project [Thunderbird-monterail](https://github.com/spymastermatt/thunderbird-monterail).
If you appreciate their work have a look at their project!

*Since I don't want to take your time anymore, let's get into it!*

## Getting Started
Now let's see how to run this application to switch the theme of Thunderbird.

### Prerequisites
To run the application you need two things:
* [The latest Java Runtime Environment (JRE)](https://java.com/en/download/)
* [And the application itself](/application/ThunderbirdThemeSwitcher.jar?raw=false)

### Installing
First install the JRE properly (watch out for the Yahoo Search) by following the steps of the Installer.

If you are done with the Java installation you can head to the downloaded application.
It does not require any additional installation and can be executed at any location any time. Feel free to move the application to any directory you like or simply trash it after usage (You can still download it here later).

## Run the application
Run this application by simply performing a double-click with your mouse on the file. 
The app launches and should show a windows similar to this:

Now click on the 'Install' button in the upper left corner to download and install the themes.

![Installing_themes](/src/main/resources/images/Installing.PNG?raw=true)

After the installation has finished you can select a theme from the dropdown.

![Select_theme](/src/main/resources/images/SelectTheme.PNG?raw=true)

Now press the 'Switch Theme' button to switch the Thunderbird theme to your choice.
* **Important: After each theme switch you have to restart Thunderbird!**

## Uninstalling
To remove all themes from Thunderbird simply hit the 'Uninstall' button in the upper right corner. This will remove all downloaded, unzipped and installed themes from your computer.

To uninstall this application just close it and delete the (.jar) file. To ensure it is completely gone head to the trash and delete it permanently.
